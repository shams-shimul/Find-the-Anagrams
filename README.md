# Find The Anagrams

**JavaScriptomas 2024 challenge from Scrimba, Day 5.**

Today's challenge is about writing a JavaScript function that will take an array that have subarrays of words/phrases. The objective of the function is that it will return the array filtering out the subarrays that do not have anagrams.

### What's an Anagram?
An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of another word or phrase, using all the original letters exactly once. For example:
- The anagram of "listen" is "silent".
- The anagram of "evil" is "vile".

So, if two or more words/phrases are anagrams to each other(s), they will essentially have the same characters with same frequencies leading to same number of characters in total.

#### Anagrams are often used as puzzles or in word games to challenge one's ability to spot hidden words or rearrange letters creatively.
